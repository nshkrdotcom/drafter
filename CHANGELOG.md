# Changelog

All notable changes to Drafter are documented here.
Versions marked with ★ were published to Hex.pm.

## [0.1.23] - 2026-03-16
### Added
- `Drafter.run/2`: `scroll_optimization: false` opt-out — disables the fast render path and debounce, reverting to a full `render_app` on every scroll tick. Default is `true` (optimisation enabled). `run_session/3` accepts the same option.

```elixir
Drafter.run(MyApp, scroll_optimization: false)
```

## [0.1.22] - 2026-03-16
### Added
- `Drafter.App`: `on_message/2` optional callback — receives any process message that is not a recognised drafter event (resize, keyboard/mouse input, widget signals, timers). Enables PubSub subscriptions, `send/2` from external processes, and GenServer-style messaging directly in the app process. Return updated state.

```elixir
def mount(_props) do
  Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(MyApp.PubSub, "data:updates")
  %{rows: []}
end

def on_message({:data_refreshed, uid, payload}, state) do
  %{state | rows: payload.rows}
end
```

Previously all unrecognised messages were silently dropped at the `_other` catch-all in both `app_event_loop` and `shared_session_loop`.

## [0.1.21] - 2026-03-16
### Added
- `Drafter.App`: `on_scroll_active/1` optional callback — fires once on the first scroll event of a gesture; return updated state (e.g. `%{state | scrolling: true}`)
- `Drafter.App`: `on_scroll_idle/1` optional callback — fires when the 150 ms debounce settles after the last scroll event; return updated state (e.g. flush pending data, clear scrolling flag)

These hooks let apps pause expensive work (data hydration, heavy renders) during scroll and resume it precisely when the gesture ends, without polling or timers.

```elixir
def on_scroll_active(state), do: %{state | scrolling: true}

def on_scroll_idle(state) do
  state = if state.pending_data, do: apply_pending_data(state), else: state
  %{state | scrolling: false, pending_data: nil}
end

def on_timer(:poll_data, %{scrolling: true} = state) do
  case DataCache.take_if_updated(state.selected_uid, state.data_version) do
    :unchanged -> state
    {:updated, payload} -> %{state | pending_data: payload}
  end
end
```

## [0.1.20] - 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- `WidgetServer`: `event_sync` no longer calls `notify_render_needed` — the event loop renders after `event_sync` returns; calling it again was flooding the mailbox with one `{:widget_render_needed}` per scroll tick
- `WidgetHierarchy`: `update_widget` no longer blocks on `WidgetServer.get_state/1` after casting `update_props` — `update_props` is now a true fire-and-forget cast; the hierarchy in-memory state is not updated, but ETS has the authoritative strips so rendering is unaffected
- `app_event_loop` / `shared_session_loop`: `{:widget_render_needed}` handler drains all pending notifications before doing a single `render_hierarchy`, eliminating N-fold duplicate composites when multiple widgets fire at once (e.g. clock + chart on the same tick)
- `app_event_loop` / `shared_session_loop`: `:scroll_debounce_render` handler drains all accumulated debounce messages before triggering one `render_app`, preventing update debt accumulation during slow/continuous scrolling where successive events arrived more than 150 ms apart
- Removed `sync_widget_states/1` — no longer needed; `render_hierarchy` reads strips directly from ETS which widget GenServers keep current

## [0.1.19] - 2026-03-16
### Changed
- `WidgetServer`: each widget owns its strip buffer via `WidgetStripCache` (ETS, public, `read_concurrency: true`) — rendering happens inside the widget's own GenServer process and results are written to ETS; `create_widget_layers_from_hierarchy` reads from ETS directly (no inter-process messaging, no round-trips)
- `WidgetServer`: `update_props` renders and writes to ETS when state changes but does **not** send `{:widget_render_needed}` — only autonomous widget state changes (events, timers) notify the event loop, eliminating redundant re-composites after `render_app`
- `WidgetServer`: `update_props` with identical resulting state is a no-op (no render, no ETS write)
- `ScrollableContainer`: scroll events use a fast render path — `render_hierarchy` re-clips ETS-cached strips without running `ComponentRenderer`; 150 ms debounce fires `render_app` once after scroll settles
- `MouseProcessor`: `mouse_move` while a button is held routes to the `mouse_down_widget` regardless of cursor position, enabling drag-out-of-bounds behaviour; `mouse_up` after drag-release outside the originating widget notifies the `mouse_down_widget` so it can clear drag state

### Added
- `WidgetStripCache`: ETS-backed strip store keyed by widget ID; lock-free reads from any process
- `ScrollableContainer`: click on scrollbar track jumps one viewport page toward the thumb
- `ScrollableContainer`: drag the scrollbar thumb — `mouse_down` on thumb begins drag, `mouse_move` continuously updates scroll offset, `mouse_up` ends drag

## [0.1.18] - 2026-03-15
### Fixed
- `DataTable`: click and Enter now toggle selection in both `:single` and `:multiple` modes — clicking or pressing Enter on an already-selected row deselects it; previously `change_selection/3` always set selection, while Space already toggled correctly via `action_toggle_selection`
- `DataTable`: arrow key navigation no longer inadvertently toggles selection in `:multiple` mode — `action_cursor_up/down` now pass `trigger_select: false` so moving the cursor never changes the selected set; only Enter, Space, and click change selection
- `Collapsible`: hidden children no longer receive mouse events — `find_widget_at` now excludes `hidden_widgets` from hit testing, preventing clicks intended for widgets beneath a collapsed section (e.g. a `DataTable` header) from being intercepted by invisible child widgets
- `Collapsible`: widget content (list) no longer renders over siblings below it — two root causes fixed:
  - `Collapsible.update/2` was resetting `content_height` to the default (10) on every re-render when only `content` was passed in `updated_props`, corrupting the stored height after the first render
  - `get_child_vertical_spec` / `get_preferred_height` ignored the `expanded:` and `content_height:` options when the widget was not yet in the hierarchy (first render), always returning height 1 and placing the next sibling at the wrong y position

## [0.1.17] - 2026-03-15
### Added
- `Digits`: `bg_data:` prop renders a braille line chart (4× vertical resolution per terminal row) behind the digit glyphs; `color:` sets the line colour; digits take priority where glyphs overlap braille dots
- `Sparkline`: `orientation: :horizontal` renders each data point as a left-to-right bar using left-aligned eighth-block characters (`▏▎▍▌▋▊▉█`)
- `Chart`: `pixel_style: :quadrant` option for line and scatter charts — uses quadrant block characters (`▖▗▘▝▚▞▛▜▟▙▀▄▌▐█`) at 2×2 pixel resolution per cell, giving larger/more visible dots than braille

## [0.1.16] - 2026-03-15
### Changed
- `Digits`: improved `B` glyph in both large and small sizes — more distinguishable from `8` and `6`; large uses flat `├` spine with `╲`/`╱` bump sides, small uses `╲` divider in the middle row

### Added
- `Rule`: new widget — horizontal/vertical divider line with optional embedded title, `title_align`, and `line_style` (`:solid`, `:double`, `:dashed`, `:thick`)
- `Tree`: `on_node_highlight:` callback fires whenever cursor moves to a new node; `Shift+←`/`Shift+→` navigates to previous/next sibling at the same depth
- `SelectionList`: `on_item_toggle:` callback fires with `{index, selected?}` on each individual item toggle; `Home`/`End` jump to first/last item; `Ctrl+A` toggles select-all / deselect-all in `:multiple` mode
- `MaskedInput`: `on_submit:` callback fires with the raw unmasked value on `Enter`
- `TextArea`: text selection (`Shift+Arrow`, `Ctrl+A`), copy/cut/paste (`Ctrl+C`/`X`/`V`), undo/redo (`Ctrl+Z`/`Y`), `read_only:`, `tab_behavior:` (`:focus` or `:indent`), `tab_size:`, `max_checkpoints:`, word navigation (`Ctrl+←`/`→`), page up/down, `highlight_cursor_line:`

## [0.1.15] - 2026-03-15
### Added
- `DataTable`: per-cell background colouring via `color_fn: (raw_value -> {r,g,b} | nil)` on column definitions; applied when the row is not selected
- `DataTable`: 3-state column sort cycle — click cycles ascending → descending → unsorted (restores original data order); `↕` indicator shown on all sortable-but-unsorted columns when `sortable: true`
- `DataTable`: table-level `sortable: false` option disables all sort indicators and click-to-sort
- `DataTable`: column width drag-resize — drag a column header to resize (when `locked: true`, the default); minimum 3 characters
- `DataTable`: column reorder — `Shift+←` / `Shift+→` moves the cursor column; drag a header while `locked: false` swaps columns live
- `DataTable`: `locked:` option — `true` (default) makes header-drag resize; `false` makes header-drag reorder
- `DataTable`: `on_layout_change:` callback — fires with `%{col_widths: [...], col_order: [...]}` after any resize or reorder
- `DataTable`: `col_widths:` and `col_order:` mount/update props to restore a previously saved layout
- `DataTable`: keyboard resize (`+`/`-`) fires `on_layout_change` after each step
- `DataTable`: `FocusRegistry` integration — footer key-binding bar updates dynamically when the table gains focus
- `FocusRegistry`: new `GenServer` tracking the focused widget's key bindings; consumed by `Footer` for dynamic display
- `EventRouter`: `{:key, key, mods}` events now dispatch to `handle_key/3` if exported, falling back to `handle_key/2`

## [0.1.14] - 2026-03-14
### Fixed
- Timer-driven re-renders skipped when `on_timer/2` returns state unchanged (`===`);
  applies to both `app_event_loop` and `shared_session_loop`. Eliminates redundant
  `render_app` / widget tree traversal on poll timers that find no new data.
- `{:widget_render_needed}` (fired by widget-internal timers such as the header clock)
  no longer triggers `ComponentRenderer.render_tree`. It now calls `render_hierarchy`
  which re-composites directly from the already-synced widget states, avoiding
  `update_widget` calls — and therefore `filter_list` — on every clock tick.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-03-14 *
### Added
- Multi-series line charts: pass a list of series (list of lists) to `chart_type: :line`
- Multi-series scatter charts: pass a list of point-lists to `chart_type: :scatter`
- `:clustered_bar` chart type — grouped multi-series bars with half-block resolution
- `:stacked_bar` chart type — series stack from baseline; supports mixed positive/negative values
- `:range_bar` chart type — each bar spans a `[low, high]` range
- Negative value support documented and verified across all chart types
- `multi_series_charts.exs` example demonstrating all new chart variants

### Fixed
- Area chart crash (`ArithmeticError`) when passed multi-series data; now dispatches to
  `render_multi_series` matching the same guard added to line chart

### Changed
- `Chart` moduledoc expanded with sections for negative values, multi-series API, and all bar types

## [0.1.11] - 2026-03-14 ★
### Added
- Scrollable viewport culling: off-screen children skipped during `render_component` calls,
  reducing GenServer traffic per frame for large scrollable lists

### Changed
- `count_component_slots/1` introduced to advance the ID counter for culled components,
  preserving auto-generated widget IDs for on-screen widgets

## [0.1.10] - 2026-03-14
### Fixed
- Chart axis labels: float concatenation crash in `format_axis_value/1` for values ≥ 1000

## [0.1.9] - 2026-03-14
### Fixed
- Binding resolution: `Checkbox` now reads `:checked` from opts at mount (was always `false`)
- `ComponentRenderer` checkbox update path now syncs `:checked` and `:on_change` on re-render
- `ComponentRenderer` `radio_set` update path now passes `:options` and `:selected` (was only
  `:on_change` and `:classes`, leaving options frozen after mount)
- `RadioSet.update/2` no longer resets `highlighted_index` on every timer-driven re-render

## [0.1.8] - 2026-03-14 ★
### Added
- Differential rendering in compositor: row-level dirty detection via `Strip.cache_key`
  (`:erlang.phash2` hash); unchanged rows skipped each frame, drastically reducing
  terminal output on static or partially-static screens
- Stale test cleanup: removed 10 test files referencing renamed/removed modules

### Fixed
- `TextInput`: scroll offset was double-subtracting border width, causing scroll to
  trigger 2 characters early
- `TextInput`: typed text no longer reset on re-render when widget has no `:bind` or
  `:value` prop

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-14 ★
### Fixed
- `RadioSet`: options passed as raw tuples were not normalised at mount; now always
  stored as `%{id: _, label: _}` maps
- `RadioSet`: options not updating on re-render after first mount
- `RadioSet`: `highlighted_index` frozen after navigating before first selection

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-14 ★
### Added
- `Collapsible` widget now supports interactive child widgets (buttons, inputs, etc.)
  inside the expanded body, not just plain text

### Fixed
- `Collapsible.update/2`: `content_height` no longer inherits stale value when content
  type changes between renders

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-13 ★
### Fixed
- SSH: reverse entry bug introduced when SSH support was added
- Local startup issues with terminal initialisation

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-13 ★
### Fixed
- Input handling cleanup following SSH integration

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-13 ★
